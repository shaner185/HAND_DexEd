# HAND_DexEd
This is a repository for my Senior Design Project. We are working on a tele-operated robotic hand that has real-time user input as well as variable haptic feedback. The focus for this project is to create a testbed that can be used as a platform to educate students in universities and public schools in robotic dexterous manipulation.
