# HAND_DexEd
This is a repository for my Senior Design Project. We are working on a tele-operated robotic hand that has real-time user input as well as variable haptic feedback. The focus for this project is to create a testbed that can be used as a platform to educate students in universities and public schools in robotic dexterous manipulation.

This section is specifically for code relating to the haptic glove. This will be for reading the user inputs, mapping the hand position to motor controls, and receing haptic feedback
